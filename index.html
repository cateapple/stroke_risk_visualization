    <h1>Prevalence of strokes</h1>
    <h3>Catherine Appleby (caa96), Esuvat Bomani (ekb72), Mia Bravo (mvb43)</h3>
    <p>Would you get married if doing so would increase your chance of a stroke? When choosing between a corporate career or a government career,
      are you considering how each affects your health, beyond salary and benefits? While we can't predict how each decision does impact your health
      or chance of a stroke, we can see how many people get strokes after having lived in each of these scenarios.

    <p> So, you've looked at the graph above and see that less than 4% more people experienced a stroke having been married than not.
      Knowing that your choice of occupation, marriage, and the environment you chose to live in isn't correlated with an increased
      chance of stroke may be relieving, but you need something to worry about. Luckily, we can see below, with health risk factors
      that often one can't control, we see higher prevalence of strokes. So, rather than worrying about how your job affects your
      chance of a stroke, you should be worrying about your blood pressure.
